# Stylised Open World
This is an in-progress open-world project which is the result of a course I'm completing. This repo serves as a code showcase, but there is only one notable class at this time, which is a CinematicCamera pawn which was used to record [YouTube footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drgVN8TIu00) of the environment.
